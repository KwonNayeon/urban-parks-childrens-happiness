# Figures Directory Overview

This directory contains all the figures used in the thesis. The figures are organized and named to distinguish whether they belong to the main document or the appendix.

## Naming Convention

- **Figure 1_XXX**: Figures starting with "Figure 1_" are included in the main document.
- **Figure A1_XXX**: Figures starting with "Figure A" followed by a number are part of the appendix.

## Figure Organization

- **Main Document Figures**
  - `Figure 1_absolute SMD before and after matching.png`: This figure illustrates the balance of covariates in the main analysis by showing the absolute SMD before and after matching.
  - `Figure 2_absolute SMD before and after matching.png`: This figure demonstrates the balance of covariates in the sensitivity analysis, depicting the absolute SMD before and after matching.

- **Appendix Figures**
  - `Figure A1_Histogram of park area per capita.png`: Histogram showing the distribution of park area per capita.
  - `Figure B1_DAG.png`: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) illustrating the causal relationships in the study.
  - `Figure C1-a_Histogram of PS distribution.png`: Histogram of Propensity Score (PS) distribution for the main analysis.
  - `Figure C1-b_Histogram of CBPS distribution.png`: Histogram of Covariate Balancing Propensity Score (CBPS) distribution for the main analysis.
  - `Figure D1-a_Histogram of PS distribution.png`: Histogram of Propensity Score (PS) distribution for the sensitivity analysis.
  - `Figure D1-b_Histogram of CBPS distribution.png`: Histogram of Covariate Balancing Propensity Score (CBPS) distribution for the sensitivity analysis.
  - `Figure E1-a_Histogram of PS distribution.png`: Histogram of Propensity Score (PS) distribution for an additional analysis with a different treatment allocation criterion.
  - `Figure E1-b_Histogram of CBPS distribution.png`: Histogram of Covariate Balancing Propensity Score (CBPS) distribution for an additional analysis with a different treatment allocation criterion.
  - `Figure E2_absolute SMD before and after matching.png`: This figure presents the balance of covariates in the additional analysis, highlighting the absolute SMD before and after matching.

## Locating Figures in the Documents

Each figure mentioned here can be found in the corresponding sections of the documents located in the `thesis` folder. The documents provide detailed context and explanations for each figure.

- **Main Document**: Refer to `Causal effect of urban parks on children’s happiness.pdf` for figures starting with "Figure 1_".
- **Appendix**: Refer to `Supplemental Materials for “Causal Effect of Urban Parks on Children’s Happiness”.pdf` for figures starting with "Figure A".

Please refer to the documents in the `thesis` folder for more detailed descriptions and the specific context in which each figure is used.
